MongoDB Operators -> Powerful yet devs won't use them 

Developers mainly use -- Maps and filter

Operators :

1. Update Operators :: 

Logical :

$inc -> increment  :: no separate operator for decrement 
Eg : +1, +4, -3, -1, etc

$min -> minimum

$max -> maximum

$set -> sets a data to an object property

$unset -> removes a property from an object


Arrays :

$push ->

$pop -> to remove element from last place

$pull -> to extract data :: from any place in an array we use filter but as an operator we have pull with same functionality.

$addToSet -> clever way of pushing data to an array.
if an entry is already present in the array then it doesn't push and if entry is not present then it pushes to the main array.
i.e. Unique elements only
